# OpenArtBlocks-Smart-Contract-Tezos

This project is part of [OpenArtBlocks](https://github.com/GenArtLabs/OpenArtBlocks), an open-source self-hosted approach to creating generative art on the Tezos and Ethereum blockchains. This allows any artist to create generative art that is constructed only at the time of minting, thus making the art truly generative.

This is a custom FA2 smart contract adapted for generative art on the Tezos blockchain.

This contract is based on https://github.com/hicetnunc2000/objkt-swap under MIT license.
